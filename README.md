# Advance-Algorithm-Scripting

This is my repo for the Free Code Camp [Advance Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org) challenges.

I don't like solving these challenges in the Free Code Camp website, so I use an testing library developed by me with the help of the [Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/p/premium) premium course. The lib name is Simple Test Lib and you can have more information about it in [here](https://github.com/forral/simple-test-lib).

Keep in mind that I didn't refactor any of the code in this challenge. I know I can write cleaner code but the objective is to finish has quick as I can. Maybe in a near future I go back and clean all the mess.
